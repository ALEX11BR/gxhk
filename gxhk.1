.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gxhk
is a hotkey daemon for X, something like \fBsxhkd\fR. What makes it special is the fact that it can be configured on-the-fly the same way as \fBbspwm\fR: through a socket in which commands to bind keys, to unbind previously bound keys, or even show infos about the bound keys can be sent.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Common options
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display some help information.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-socket " " \fIpath
Use \fIpath\fR as the socket path instead of the default \fI/tmp/gxhk.sock\fR.

.SS Daemon-start-only options
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \-\-no\-default\-configs
By default, when the daemon starts, it will execute the config file from \fI/etc/gxhkrc\fR and from \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gxhk/gxhkrc\fR. This flag supresses this behaviour.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-config " " \fIpath
Run the config file from \fIpath\fR, in addition to all the others.

.SS Daemon commands
.TP
\fBgxhk\fR bind [\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-released\fR] \fIKEY\fR \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIDESCRIPTION\fR]
Binds the hotkey expressed by \fIKEY\fR so that whenever it gets pressed (or released if the \fB--released\fR flag is set), \fBsh -c \fICOMMAND\fR gets executed. \fIDESCRIPTION\fR is an optional description to be used in the 'info' command.

.TP
\fBgxhk\fR unbind [\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-released\fR] \fIKEY\fR
Unbinds the hotkey that was bound using the 'bind' command with the same parameters.

.TP
\fBgxhk\fR info [\fIKEY\fR]
Show the currently bound keys with the descriptions of their commands, or, if they haven't been provided, a dummy text which shows the commands they spawn. If the \fIKEY\fR argument is set, show only infos about the commands that hotkey spawns.
An example of its output is listed below:

.EX
On mod4-d press: Launch app menu
On print press: Spawn 'maim ~/screenshot-$(date +%s).png"'
On mod4-shift-return release: Launch terminal
.EE

.SH KEYS SYNTAX

Key sequences are human readable strings made up of zero or more modifiers andexactly one key. Namely:
.IP
.EX
[Mod[-Mod[...]]-]KEY
.EE
.P
'Mod' can be one of: shift, control, mod1, mod3, mod4, mod5. You can view which keys activate each modifier using the 'xmodmap' program.

KEY must correspond to a valid keysym. Keysyms can be found by pressing keys using the 'xev' program.

An example key sequence might look like 'Mod4-Control-Shift-t'. The keybinding
for that key sequence is activated when all three modifiers: mod4, control and
shift are pressed along with the 't' key.
